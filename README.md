# When I Work challenge

Challenge:

```
http://svc.metrotransit.org/ - Consume Nextrip's api for Minneapolis transit info. Make an app where I can find routes running today, can find stops for those routes, and then departure times for those stops.
```

TODO: it would be ideal to get a list of Providers and cache that information (Realm? SharedPrefs?) to display on RoutesActivity.
TODO: better/more animations, material design
